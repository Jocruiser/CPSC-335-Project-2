Problem was implemented using Python

The array included starting indices of the target source in array one. If the length of the source subtracted from the index is less than 
the length of the target word then it is continued. The source index of the target length is assigned to a substring. If the target is equal to the substring
then the output order is appended to the index and the output array is appended to the target. Index is then incremeneted by 1. The output order and output
array are then returned to the user. 
In the main function the file in2a.txt is opened as a read in file and is read line by line. 
While it is on the line the split method will split the string for every quotation (") and the strings are stored at odd index; this occurs for both the 
source string and target string. The result is then printed and the file is closed.
